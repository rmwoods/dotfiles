# Overview

This repo contains "dotfiles" - configuration files for bash and other programs on linux. I've also included some scripts to set up these files on a new machine.

## bash

The following files are configurations for bash:

* bashrc (~/.bashrc)
* bash\_aliases (~/.bash\_aliases)

## python

The following files are configurations for python/python packages:

* ipython (~/.ipython/\*)
* matplotlibrc (~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc) 

## VIM

The following files are configurations and extensions for VIM.
